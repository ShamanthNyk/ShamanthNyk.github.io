#excerpt: 'This paper proposes a system to secure text-based data sharing between users using a hybrid encryption methodology. On the other hand, encryption algorithms consume a significant amount of time for computation. This paper provides an evaluation of 6 different algorithmic combinations: AES+RSA, DES+RSA, 3DES+RSA, RC4+RSA, Blowfish+RSA and Rabbit+RSA. A comparison study has been conducted for the different combinations by using files with different file sizes to determine which algorithmic combination is best for the proposed system. The simulation results have been published to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithmic combinations and suitability for the proposed system.'

This paper proposes a system to secure text-based data sharing between users using a hybrid encryption methodology. On the other hand, encryption algorithms consume a significant amount of time for computation. This paper provides an evaluation of 6 different algorithmic combinations: AES+RSA, DES+RSA, 3DES+RSA, RC4+RSA, Blowfish+RSA and Rabbit+RSA. A comparison study has been conducted for the different combinations by using files with different file sizes to determine which algorithmic combination is best for the proposed system. The simulation results have been published to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithmic combinations and suitability for the proposed system.<br>
