Hello, I'm a seond-year Master's (thesis) student at **Concordia University, Montreal** specializing in Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing. My research is currently focused on evaluating Large Langugae Models (LLMs) in various Discourse tasks under the supervision of [Dr. Leila Kosseim](https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~kosseim/) at [CLaC](https://www.concordia.ca/ginacody/computer-science-software-eng/research/groups/computational-linguistics.html). I am also working on leveraging LLMs for generating text that captures relevant aspects of various chacarcters in a game under [Dr. Jonathan Lessard](https://www.concordia.ca/faculty/jonathan-lessard.html).
<br>

I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer and Communications at Manipal Institute of Technology, India in 2022. During my undergaduate studies, I was fortunate enough to conduct research in AI on multiple occasions. I have worked as a GRM Project Intern at IBM under [Mr. Balaji Ganesan](https://research.ibm.com/people/balaji-ganesan) on Explainability of Graph Neural Networks for Tabular Data and Entity Matching. In 2021, I also got an oppurtunity to work under the supervision of [Dr. Yllias Chali](https://www.cs.uleth.ca/~chali/) at University of Lethbridge, Canada on text summarization and query generation as a part of the Mitacs Globalink Internship program.
<br>
 
My research interests span several areas, including Computer Vision, NLP, Semi/Self-supervised Learning, Zero-Shot Learning, Domain Adaptation/Generalization, and Continual Learning. I am particularly interested in developing deep learning solutions using minimal or no supervision. My ultimate goal is to create intelligent systems that can learn from and adapt to the complex, ever-changing environments we encounter in the real world.
<br>

In my free time, I enjoy sharing my research interests and insights by streaming research paper explanations on my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/SahilKhose). I am currently seeking ML research positions for the summer of 2023, and I invite you to check out my [CV](https://sahilkhose.github.io/files/Sahil_Khose.pdf) and contact me if you are interested in collaborating. Let's make progress together!
