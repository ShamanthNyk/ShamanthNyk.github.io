Hello, I'm a seond-year Master's (thesis) student at **Concordia University, Montreal** specializing in Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing. My research is currently focused on evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in various Discourse tasks including but not limited to segmentation, connective identification and relation classification under the supervision of [Dr. Leila Kosseim](https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~kosseim/) at [CLaC](https://www.concordia.ca/ginacody/computer-science-software-eng/research/groups/computational-linguistics.html). I am also working on leveraging LLMs for generating text that captures relevant aspects of various chacarcters in a game under [Dr. Jonathan Lessard](https://www.concordia.ca/faculty/jonathan-lessard.html).
<br>

I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer and Communications at Manipal Institute of Technology, India in 2022. During my undergaduate studies, I was fortunate enough to conduct research in AI on multiple occasions. I have worked as a GRM Project Intern at IBM under [Mr. Balaji Ganesan](https://research.ibm.com/people/balaji-ganesan) on Explainability of Graph Neural Networks for Tabular Data and Entity Matching. In 2021, I got an oppurtunity to work under the supervision of [Dr. Yllias Chali](https://www.cs.uleth.ca/~chali/) at University of Lethbridge, Canada on Text Summarization and Query Generation as a part of the Mitacs Globalink Internship program. I have also conducted reserach under [Dr. Santosh KV](https://manipal.edu/mit/department-faculty/faculty-list/santhosh-kv.html) at MIT, Manipal. I also interned as a Software Engineer at Cisco Systems, India for a brief period of time. I was also the Expertise Head for AI  and have served as a mentor at [Research Society Manipal](http://www.researchsocietymit.com/) during my bachelors.

<br>
 
My research interests include, but are not limited to, Discourse Analysis, Text Summarization and Generation, Explainable AI, and Speech Recognition. These areas of focus are particularly important to me as I aim to develop practical applications in low-resource languages, which aligns with my long-term goal. I aspire to contribute to the field by addressing challenges and advancing knowledge in these domains.
<br>

Apart from conducting research, I actively contribute to open-source initiatives in my free time. Additionally, I dedicate time to teaching high school students how to code, fostering their learning and development in this field. Moreover, as a hobby, I thoroughly enjoy acquiring proficiency in new languages. This pursuit of language learning allows me to broaden my horizons and helping my research.
